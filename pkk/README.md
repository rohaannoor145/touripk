## 🚀 Deployment

### PythonAnywhere (Current)

Key deployment settings:

- Python 3.10 with virtualenv
- SQLite database
- WhiteNoise for static file serving
- `DEBUG=False` in production

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Set `DEBUG=False`
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- [ ] Set a strong `SECRET_KEY`
- [ ] Configure Stripe live keys
- [ ] Set up proper database (PostgreSQL recommended)
- [ ] Run `python manage.py collectstatic`
- [ ] Configure HTTPS

### Recent Updates (v3.0 — Feb 2026)

#### Company Dashboard Improvements

- **Pending Bookings stat card** now has equal height/layout as other stat cards (Total Packages, Total Products, Total Bookings) via an `awaiting confirmation` subtitle.
- **4th Quick-Action button** ("Recent Bookings") added to the dashboard action row, scrolling directly to the Recent Bookings section.
- **Product Orders in Recent Bookings**: The Recent Bookings section now shows two sub-tables — _Package Bookings_ and _Product Orders_ — so company owners can see both tour bookings and product orders in one place.
- **Backend** (`packages/company_views.py`): `company_portal` view now fetches recent product orders (`content.Order`) filtered by the company's products and passes them as `recent_product_orders` to the template.
